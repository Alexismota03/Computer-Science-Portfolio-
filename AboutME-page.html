        <h2 class="heading-me">Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="me">I am a 14 year old Mexican-American. My parents and my older sister were born in Mexico, while my younger sister and I were born here in California. I always like to be active, and I am really competitive.Like every person I like to play all kinds of games, like board-games, video games, card games, and so much more. Again, like most people I love to watch yuotube videos. For me youtube has the answer to anything. For example you may not know how to hide a body, just search it up and it will probably be there. </p>
        
        
        <h2 class="heading-me">What are my Hobbies?</h2>
         <p class="me">Like I just said I love to always be active, and my favorite way to do that is playing soccer. I also like the other sports like basketball, volleyball, football, dodgeball, and so much more. You may be thinking, oh okay a lot of people like sports, and they do. The difference between those people and me is that I loved sports so much that I signed up for a program to try and play sports from around the world.I would always find a way to be active because I loved to win, and again you might say so deos everyone else. But the thing is even at CARD GAMES I get super competitive.  </p>
        
        <h2 class="heading-me">What do I do in my free time?</h2>
         <p class="me"> If you can't guess yet if I could I would probably be active all day long just playing all kinds of sports. You guys could also probably guess that I would play games all day long and night if I could. The thing is that i would play all kinds of games. After telling you a little about my self you wouldn't think that I actually like to read. Before you get ahead of yourself and think that it's my favorite thing stop, no it's not I only do it a lot when I get really into a book or I am forced to read it. And usually when that happens I fall asleep reading the book.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading-me"> What are my favorite kinds of food?</h2>
         <p class="me">Obviously since I am mexican my favorite food is mexican. I don't know why but if you ever ask me what kind of food I want there is a 90% chance that I will say Mexican. Now don't get me wrong I do like other kinds of food like chinese, italian, American, and etc. Now that I really think about it I like all kinds of food. As long as the food looks edible I will eat it.</p>
