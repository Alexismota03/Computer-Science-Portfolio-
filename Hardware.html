        <h2 class="h-hw">What is a hardware??</h2>
        <p class="hw">Some people may may not know what a hardware is, so that's why I'm here to explain. By definition a computer hardware is the collection of physical parts of a computer system.  This includes the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  It also includes all the parts inside the computer case, such as the hard disk drive, motherboard, video card, and many others. Computer hardware is what you can physically touch. So you can see that a computer needs a computer hardware, and it would be pretty hard to make a computer without a hardware. </p>
        
        
        <h2 class="h-hw">Why is a hardware needed?</h2>
         <p class="hw">Well if you read the last paragraph a hardware is connected to everything and it pretty makes everythingwork. It is what makes the keyboards, monitors and everything esle in the computer work. The hardware is pretty much a combination of the brain and a heart of something. The reason I say this is because the hardware lets a computer turn on a computer, like a heart, and the hardware is always doing things and working, just like the brain. So I doubt brains would work if there was no hardware, but I'll get into that later. </p>
        
        <h2 class="h-hw">How does a hardware work?</h2>
         <p class="hw">See, the computer is an amazingly useful general-purpose technology, to the point that now cameras, phones, thermostats .. these are all now little computers. This section will cover a lot of ground, introducing major parts and themes of how computer hardware works. "Hardware" refers the physical parts of the computer, and "software" refers to the code that runs on the computer. These are deep and complicated topics, but many of the basic principles make perfect sense and will give you an insight about what's going on behind the scenes.</p>
        
        <h2 class="h-hw"> What would happen if computers had no hardware?</h2>
         <p class="hw">See if computers had no hardware, they would not wxist work or do anything. Now you may say it's just computers, but no it's not it's pretty much technology. Our technology needs a hardware from phones to thermometers, so really woithout a hardware technology is nothing and technically never existed without it. </p>
