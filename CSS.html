        <h2 class="heading-CSS">What is HTML/CSS?</h2>
        <p class="HTML">The definition of HTML/CSS is, HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Although HTML and CSS have many similarities HTML and CSS are very very different.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="heading-CSS">What is the difference betwwen HTML and CSS?</h2>
         <p class="HTML">Now even though HTML and CSS can be condusing they are very different. This is because HTML is coding, it does the writing. For example, I am using HTML to write this and everything that is writing was probably prgrammed by HTML. NOw while HTML does this CSS is style. For example aqll the borders, colors, backgrounds and pictures are for style. They are not needed, but it looks neccesary.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading-CSS">Why is HTMl/CSS so important?</h2>
         <p class="HTML">Well some people may wonder, "Why is HTML so importamt it's not like we need it?", but yet those people are the same people that don't notice what they have until it's gone. For example, they probably browse the media the most or watch videos, or use the computer websites for schoolwork, and they don't notice that all of that stuff is HTML. Computers wouldn't work without HTML. It's that easy.</p>
