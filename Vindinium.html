        <h2 class="heading-vindinium">What is Vindinium?</h2>
        <p class="game-info">Well to fill you in with a brief explanation of what vindinium is,  it is a pretty simple game 
        that has an objective of having the most amount of gold than the other 3 players that will playing as well. Now to 
        get gold our bots need to claim goldmines around the map, but they need to make sure they don't die in the process.
        Someone could die if they don't visit the tavern which gives them health, and they could lose health by attacking 
        others  and by getting too many mines since you lose heatlh when you gain a mine. Everyone gets one turn at a time 
        and in total there are a number of 1200 turns and at the end, the bot with the most amount of gold wins the match, 
        and a key importance is that when you kill a person you take all of their mines.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading-vindinium">Explaining my code</h3>
        <div class="game-info">The very fisrt part of my code was <code><pre>
        var enemyBots = [];
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
        if(bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);
        </pre></code>
        which shows the variable for bots and then the if statements run a code that will determine which of the players, 1-4
        is my bot, so later it will target the variable "enemyBots".
        
        The next part of my code is "<code><pre> var mostMines = enemyBots[0];
       for(i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++){
            if(mostMines.mineCount < enemyBots[i].mineCount){
              mostMines = enemyBots[i]  
            }
        }</pre></code>, and this code will decide which of the other bots has the most amount of mines, which I will discuss 
        why I  did this later on.The next part of my code does a lot of things and I will explain what those things are.The 
        code is <code><pre> var task;
        task = "freemines";
        if(bot.yourBot.life < 50){
            task = "bot.taverns";
        }else if(mostMines.mineCount > 5){
            task = "mostMines";
        }
        else if(bot.yourBot.mineCount > enemyBots[0].mineCount && bot.yourBot.mineCount > enemyBots[1].mineCount 
        && bot.yourBot.mineCount > enemyBots[2].mineCount){
            task = "bot.taverns";
        }else{
            task = "freemines";
        }</pre></code>and the task means that what will the task will be. The first part tells the bot if his health is less
        than 50 than he should go get health, but if his health his higher than 50 he will target the person with the most 
        amount of mines. Then if he has the most amount of mines he will go to a tavern and stay there for the rest of the 
        game. Then the last part is to just target the remaining of the freemines. The next part of the code will explain 
        what the bots will do according to their tasks. <code><pre>if(task === "freemines") {
            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = bot.freeMines[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Claiming a Free Mine!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);
        }</pre></code>If the task is the freemine then it will locate the closest mine and claim it and it will say "claiming
        a Free Mine!" when it does. The next part is <code><pre></pre>if(task === "bot.taverns"){
            var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++){
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestTavern)> bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])){
                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
                }       
            }
            console.log("Got health");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestTavern);
            
        }
        </pre></code> 
        
        <p>And this means that when the task is to go to the taverns, it will again locate the closest tavern and go 
        to it to gain health(which is the first of three things that I was suppose to make it do) and it will then say 
        "Got health".</p>
        <code><pre>if(task === "mostMines"){
            console.log("I'm gonna win");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, mostMines.posArray)
        }</pre></code>
        
        Now this final code is when my bot either has the most amount of mines which means it will stay at a tavern(which 
        was the second of three things that I made it do), but if it does not hav the most amount of mines it will attack 
        whoever does have the most amount of mines to take their mines(which was the 3rd of three things that I made it do).
        
        <code><pre>if(myDir === "none") {
            console.log("Going Random!");
            var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
            var dirs = ["north", "south", "east", "west"];
            bot.goDir = dirs[rand];
        } else {
            bot.goDir = myDir;
        }</pre></code>
        
        So this final code in my code sets my bots direction based on (direction). If  my bot is trying to go to a place 
        that he can't reach, he will move randomly. Otherwise he'll move in the direction set by my code.

        <h3 class="heading-vindinium">What I learned about AI?</h3>
        <p class="game-info">One question that people asked a lot if it was really difficult, and how long did it take me to 
        make the bot do specific things, and the main answer was yes and no. The reason for yes was because I mean we had to 
        program it andsomethings were a lot more difficult than other things.For example making it stay at a tavern when it 
        had all of the mines took me around 2 days, by just figuring it out, while making it go to a tavern when he had low 
        health took not even half a day. So it mainly just depends on what code you're programing, because I already had some
        experience with some parts. Now another reason was that sometimes the bot would crash a .ot or even worse it wouldn't 
        do what I wantedit to do. Now the reason was because I would lose a game and it get very competitive. Although this 
        project was difficult, my thoughts on an AI did change a lot. At the begging I though that discover AI's or would
        (rarely) sometimes invent AI's which I thought you had to be extremely smart, but now I know that all of the AI's
        are made and that they aren't perfect either, and they sometimes may have bugs in them as do we.</p>
